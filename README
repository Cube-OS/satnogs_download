Satellite IDs:

Satnogs downloader will download the data from observations
and store them in folders named by the satellite ID.

Folder will contain 2 files:
- *.raw: the raw data file
- *.url: file containing all URL links to individual data packets

Afterwards run `cuava-beacon-decoder -i "ID.raw" -o "ID.txt/json"` to generate JSON files.
